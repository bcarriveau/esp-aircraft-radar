# Bill's Aircraft Radar

A dedicated 7-inch ESP32-S3 ADS-B aircraft radar display built with PlatformIO,
Arduino C++, and LVGL.

This repository targets one exact device:

- **Board:** Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7
- **Display:** 7-inch 800x480 RGB LCD with ST7262 controller
- **Touch:** GT911 capacitive touchscreen
- **I/O expander:** CH422G
- **Processor:** ESP32-S3
- **Memory:** OPI PSRAM with XIP enabled
- **Framework:** Arduino-ESP32 3.0.7 high-performance build
- **UI:** LVGL 8.3.11

It is not compatible with the Waveshare 7B, 7C, P4, generic 7-inch panels,
Cheap Yellow Display hardware, ESPHome, or e-paper projects.

## Current status

Current GitHub build marker:

```text
7IN-20260724-PRODUCT33-UI-POLISH-R5
```

Current source branch:

```text
main
```

The hardened version-controlled baseline is **Product 15**, with the recommended
tag:

```text
product-15-hardened
```

Product 33 R5 is the current UI-cleanup source in GitHub. Repository evidence
identifies Product 33 R3 as the physically tested source used for the later R4
and R5 refinements. Product 33 R5 should remain a candidate until a complete
PlatformIO build, physical UI check, normal ADS-B operation, and soak testing
are confirmed.

## Features

### Live radar

- Displays all retained aircraft as radar contacts.
- Provides 20, 40, and 80 mile radar ranges.
- Uses the compact radar selector as the only range control.
- Shows themed contact tags at the 20-mile range.
- Uses stable ICAO hex identity for contact taps, selection, and tracking.
- Prioritizes tracked and selected tags during collision-aware label placement.
- Keeps selected aircraft visible with amber styling.
- Keeps tracked aircraft visible with red styling.
- Automatically zooms outward when a tracked aircraft approaches the edge.
- Presents aircraft speed in MPH.

### Radar interaction

Idle state:

- Left panel shows aircraft count, nearest-aircraft information, and data status.
- Right panel shows the nearest five aircraft.
- Tapping the nearest aircraft, a radar contact, or a radar tag selects it.

Selected state:

- Selected details take priority in the right panel.
- INFO opens aircraft details and returns to Radar.
- TRACK begins stable ICAO-based tracking.
- CLEAR removes the selection.
- The left panel shows up to three nearest other aircraft.

Tracked state:

- Tracked details take priority in the right panel.
- STOP TRACK is contained in the tracked-aircraft card.
- The radar tag shows TRACKED, the aircraft identifier, and MPH.
- The left panel shows the nearest other aircraft without replacing the tracked
  aircraft.
- Stopping tracking preserves selection when practical.

### Additional pages

- **Tracks:** Aircraft table with details and explicit return-to-Tracks behavior.
- **Airspace:** Live totals, range metrics, aircraft-category cards, and traffic
  highlights.
- **Setup:** Display name, Wi-Fi, location, and device controls.
- **System:** Build, network, memory, diagnostics, and project identification.

## Architecture and reliability

### ADS-B networking

- All ADS-B requests and Wi-Fi recovery run in one core-0 network task.
- Requests cannot overlap.
- Polling uses a 15-second start-to-start cadence.
- The native ESP-IDF HTTPS path retains the configured secure fallback behavior.
- The firmware does not use blocking `HTTPClient::GET()`.
- Connect, header, body-idle, and total-response deadlines are bounded.
- Wi-Fi, DNS, TCP, TLS, HTTP, body, and JSON failures are classified separately.
- Recovery escalates from retry to reconnect, radio recycle, and last-resort
  restart.
- The last good aircraft snapshot remains visible during temporary failures.

### Request and state safety

- Range and location changes increment a request generation.
- Obsolete responses cannot overwrite a newer range or location selection.
- Radar rendering uses one coherent target snapshot per frame.
- LVGL labels and page content update only when their underlying versions change.
- Aircraft selection and tracking use stable ICAO hex values, never array
  positions.

### Target capacity

- Storage is bounded at 200 retained targets.
- Capacity-scaled target arrays and radar metadata use required PSRAM.
- Retention remains nearest-first while preserving the tracked aircraft when it
  is returned.
- Diagnostics distinguish received, eligible, stored, capacity-dropped, and
  visible aircraft counts.
- Array allocation sizes, bounds checks, counters, and indexes must remain tied
  to the same capacity constant.

### Display stability

The display configuration intentionally preserves:

- Arduino-ESP32 3.0.7 high-performance XIP/PSRAM framework
- OPI PSRAM and `BOARD_HAS_PSRAM`
- Existing Waveshare RGB timing
- DMA and anti-rolling protections
- 20-scanline RGB bounce buffer

Do not replace the framework, change panel timing, or reduce the bounce buffer
without a dedicated display-stability investigation.

## Repository layout

```text
assets/                 Aircraft artwork and display assets
include/                Shared interfaces and hardware configuration
src/                    Application, networking, state, radar, and UI sources
platformio.ini          Pinned PlatformIO environment and libraries
README.md               Current project documentation
```

Private credentials belong only in `include/config.h`. That file must remain
ignored and must never be committed, uploaded, or included in replacement ZIPs.

## Setup

### 1. Install the tools

Install:

- Visual Studio Code
- PlatformIO extension
- Git

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcarriveau/esp-aircraft-radar.git
cd esp-aircraft-radar
```

### 3. Create the private configuration

Copy the example file:

```bash
cp include/config.example.h include/config.h
```

Edit `include/config.h` with the local Wi-Fi credentials and radar-center
coordinates.

Never commit this file.

### 4. Build

PlatformIO environment:

```text
waveshare-s3-touch-lcd-7
```

Command-line build:

```bash
pio run -e waveshare-s3-touch-lcd-7
```

The project pins:

- pioarduino platform-espressif32 51.03.07
- Arduino-ESP32 3.0.7 high-performance libraries
- ESP32_Display_Panel 0.1.4
- ESP32_IO_Expander 0.0.3
- LVGL 8.3.11
- ArduinoJson 7.3.1

### 5. Upload and monitor

```bash
pio run -e waveshare-s3-touch-lcd-7 -t upload
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

The programming USB-C port is normally used for upload and Serial Monitor.

## Expected startup checks

Confirm the serial log reports:

- The intended Product build marker
- PSRAM detected
- App-state, radar, UI, and ADS-B buffers allocated in PSRAM
- The core-0 ADS-B task started
- Native HTTPS or the configured fallback connected successfully
- Aircraft received, eligible, stored, dropped, and published counts
- No immediate TLS memory-allocation failure
- No display rolling during HTTPS activity

## Verification checklist

Source review, compilation, physical testing, and soak testing are separate
verification stages.

Before calling a Product release complete:

1. Compile and link the full PlatformIO project.
2. Record flash and internal RAM usage.
3. Confirm the build marker, OPI PSRAM, and 20-scanline bounce buffer.
4. Test normal 15-second updates and 20/40/80 mile range changes.
5. Test selection, INFO, BACK, TRACK, STOP TRACK, CLEAR, and page navigation.
6. Interrupt Wi-Fi or the router and confirm recovery.
7. Change range during an active request and confirm stale-response rejection.
8. Check display stability during HTTPS traffic.
9. Check heap and PSRAM stability.
10. Complete an extended soak test.

## Screenshots

Verified Product 33 R5 screenshots are not currently committed. Add current
physical-display photos under a dedicated `docs/images/` directory after the
Product 33 R5 UI and touch behavior are physically confirmed.

Detailed Product-by-Product history belongs in `CHANGELOG.md` after it is built
from confirmed GitHub commits, build markers, logs, and preserved evidence.
Unconfirmed older history should not be guessed.
